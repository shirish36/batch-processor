# JFrog API Key Authentication Debug

## Current Status
❌ **Authentication Failed** - All tokens tested are not working

## Tested API Keys & Tokens
1. `cmVm****` (API Key #1)
2. `cmVm****` (API Key #2)
3. `a0p4****` (Identity Token)
4. `cmVm****` (Reference Token - latest)

## Tested Username Formats
- `shirishrane26@gmail.com`
- `shirishrane26`
- API key as username

## All Tests Failed With
```
Error response from daemon: Get "https://trial4jlj6w.jfrog.io/v2/": unknown: Bad Credentials
```

## Next Steps to Debug

### 1. Verify API Key in JFrog Web UI
1. Login to https://trial4jlj6w.jfrog.io
2. Go to **User Menu (top right)** → **Edit Profile** → **Generate an API Key**
3. Or go to **Administration** → **User Management** → **Access Tokens**
4. Verify the key is active and has correct permissions

### 2. Check Repository Access
1. In JFrog UI, go to **Artifactory** → **Repositories**
2. Verify `shirish-docker-docker-local` repository exists and you have permissions
3. Check if the repository is configured for Docker access

### 3. Verify Registry URL Format
Your current registry should be one of these:
- `trial4jlj6w.jfrog.io` (general Docker registry)
- `trial4jlj6w.jfrog.io/shirish-docker` (specific repository)

### 4. Test Authentication Manually
Try these commands with a fresh API key:

```powershell
# Test 1: With email as username
echo "YOUR_NEW_API_KEY" | docker login trial4jlj6w.jfrog.io --username shirishrane26@gmail.com --password-stdin

# Test 2: With just username
echo "YOUR_NEW_API_KEY" | docker login trial4jlj6w.jfrog.io --username shirishrane26 --password-stdin

# Test 3: Check if repository access works
docker pull trial4jlj6w.jfrog.io/shirish-docker-docker-local/batch-processor:latest
```

### 5. Alternative: Use Identity Token
If API key doesn't work, try creating an **Identity Token**:
1. In JFrog UI: **Administration** → **User Management** → **Access Tokens**
2. Create new token with **Docker** scope
3. Use token as password with your username

## Troubleshooting Checklist
- [x] API key is active and not expired ✅ (Fresh tokens generated)
- [x] Username format tested (both email and username only) ✅
- [x] Repository permissions are set correctly ❓ (Need to verify)
- [ ] Docker registry is enabled for your repository ❓ (Critical issue)
- [ ] Trial account limitations might restrict Docker access ⚠️ (Most likely cause)

## **LIKELY ROOT CAUSE: JFrog Trial Account Docker Limitations**

JFrog Cloud trial accounts often have restricted Docker registry access. The authentication failure despite valid tokens suggests:

1. **Docker Registry Not Enabled**: Your trial account may not have Docker registry functionality enabled
2. **Repository Configuration**: The `shirish-docker-docker-local` repository might not be properly configured for Docker access
3. **Trial Limitations**: JFrog Cloud trials sometimes restrict container registry features

## **IMMEDIATE SOLUTIONS**

### Option 1: Verify Docker Registry Setup in JFrog
1. Login to https://trial4jlj6w.jfrog.io
2. Go to **Administration** → **Repositories** → **Local**
3. Click on `shirish-docker-docker-local`
4. **Verify these settings**:
   - Repository Type: `Docker`
   - Docker API Version: `V2`
   - Enable Docker V1 API: `Unchecked`
   - Docker Tag Retention: `1` (or as needed)
5. Go to **Administration** → **Security** → **Settings**
6. **Check**: "Allow Anonymous Access" is disabled
7. **Check**: Docker repositories are listed in the repository configuration

### Option 2: Alternative Registry Solutions
Since authentication is failing despite valid tokens, consider these alternatives:

#### A. Use Google Container Registry (Already Setup)
Your infrastructure already has GCR configured. We can:
1. Build and push directly to GCR instead of JFrog
2. Modify the workflow to skip JFrog entirely
3. Deploy from GCR to Cloud Run Job

#### B. Use GitHub Container Registry
1. Build and push to `ghcr.io`
2. Free and integrated with GitHub Actions
3. No additional authentication setup required

### Option 3: Upgrade JFrog Account
If Docker registry is essential:
1. Upgrade to JFrog Cloud Pro trial (if available)
2. Or use JFrog Cloud Pro free tier (limited but functional)

## **RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS**

### Immediate Action: Test with GCR Instead
Let's modify your deployment workflow to use GCR directly:

1. **Skip JFrog → Use GCR**: Modify the workflow to build and push directly to `gcr.io/mission-2025-devops`
2. **Test Deployment**: This will unblock your Cloud Run Job deployment immediately
3. **JFrog Later**: Once JFrog Docker registry is properly configured, we can add it back

### Verify JFrog Docker Configuration
If you want to continue with JFrog:
1. Check repository settings as described above
2. Contact JFrog support about trial account Docker limitations
3. Verify your trial includes Docker registry features

## Once Fixed
Update GitHub secret `JFROG_PASSWORD` with the working API key/token and test the deployment workflow.
